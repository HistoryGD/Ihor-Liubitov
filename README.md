<h3 align="left">About me 👩‍💻 </h3>

###

<p align="left">I'm a beginner backend developer. I have been involved in computers and digitalization for many years. I am also very familiar with operating systems settings and software. I also do programming.
Since the fall of 2022, I have independently studied various areas. I tried to learn C++, JavaScript, tried my hand at application testing, but most of all I was hooked on Backend development.
In particular, mobile and desktop development applications, as well as websites that work with C#/.NET, Java and MySQL and MSSQL databases.</p>
